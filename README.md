# Wordpress Works
Just some projects that I've built on Wordpress. All of them were built using PHP and Javascript (VueJS).

### [MIBR - CSGO e-Sports Team](MIBR)

This site integrated with Twitch, Instagram, and competitive gaming schedules for an e-sports team. I built it using PHP and VueJS mostly. As a nod to their game (CS:GO), I added an exciting Easter egg.

If you visit their website (https://www.mibr.gg/) and press:

You'll discover that I recreated a part of the game within their website. It's a simple solution but absolutely something that I loved to work on, and I'm proud of the output.
